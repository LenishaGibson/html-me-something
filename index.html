  I have always looked at the commitment to creating new avenues of political and institutional
  power that is effective and efficient as a main goal of the majority of work I participate in. 
  Being born and raised in an inner city of South Florida, you learn the importance of understanding
  how various systems around you work and how it impacts not only your personal life but also your 
  community, your officials, your churches and consequently, future generations. The community I grew
  up in no longer exists as I knew. The name has changed. The hair salons, restaurants and barbershops 
  that once painted the historic black business district is either no longer there or sparse. Matter 
  fact, the memorable orange tree in my old backyard is gone. However, it’s finally gotten the sidewalks, 
  speed bumps and parks that we wanted when we were younger. Majority of the potholes have been filled 
  and more recently they are installing the electrical poles underground. The place is now called by 
  a name I have no connection to and neither does my community. It has been painted with a new face 
  that’s marketable to a new demographic and the cultural wealth of that community is stripped. But 
  this is not just an issue that I have experienced in South Florida. No, this is more than a localized, 
  regionalized issue. I have conversed with members of the black community in urban cities around the 
  country, that have the same sentiments about the areas in which we grew up. In cities like Chicago, 
  Detroit, Washington D.C. and Oakland, amongst countless others, we have voiced the fact that our own 
  offspring will most likely not have access to their grandparents stomping grounds. They won’t know the 
  religious sites, barbershops, parks, events or reasons behind the cultural wealth that has been erased 
  in our communities.

  This experience in many ways brought me to the work I continuously do currently. I wanted to be more 
  aware of how I can personally be active in protecting and teaching our narrative at this time but also 
  moving folks in our communities into sustainable collective action based in knowledge and awareness. 
  That to me is why building centralized black political power is essential in today’s political climate 
  because although historically we have always voted centered on racial unity showing a collective front 
  of solidarity even when our political ideologies have differed, it is now time to go the the drawing 
  board and shift the way we vote in order to benefit our communities on every front.

  It is well known at although the black community has acquired gains in participation and representation 
  within the political context, we are continuously challenged with shifting our political preferences 
  into implemented legislation. Within my organizing efforts in college, I vividly remember talking with 
  folks in our communities about the importance of voting only to be met with the response of frustration, 
  agitation or apathy. I continuously tackle challenging their root issue behind not voting and why not 
  moving to action didn’t make this any better. Building centralized black political power is being able 
  to ensure no one in our communities harbor these feelings and it not be heard or acted upon until an 
  election season. My personal definition of democracy is making sure policies reflect the communities 
  they represent, so that folks feel involved in every aspect of their community. A lens of consistent 
  engagement with community members so that elected officials understand they are under a microscope 
  when it comes to issues our communities care about and if they don’t act accordingly they are dismissed 
  from advocating for our communities. Often times the black community is viewed as a captured minority, 
  which is socially pressured into voting on prioritized issues for nothing in return. Our ability to be 
  captured every two to four years has been a disadvantage to our communities because our agenda 
  (if we have any) tends to not include commitment, accountability or evaluations of the work being done. 
  Building black political power establishes a system of checks and balances amongst our community and 
  elected officials where we demand continuous opportunities to strategize together in order to, make 
  sure benchmarks within are communities are gradually increasing. Building black political power is 
  dismantling no news is good news until you need my vote for the next election.

  To conclude, in order to dismantle the root of issues we are facing on a daily basis it is going to 
  take a new method, structure and energy within the political realm to ensure we actually meet the 
  change we have been waiting for or striving towards for centuries. Black political power is a new 
  education, wisdom and awareness personified as tools needed to shift every aspect of our lives 
  because we are not one dimensional individuals that can’t focus on multilayered issues like 
  what’s happening in our cities. I am in hopes that being a participant in this program provide 
  me with cutting edge tools to take back to our communities and create new vibrant approaches to 
  tackling the issues we are facing. In this work, collective action, mentorship and educations 
  ensures that the strategies being used can bring about necessary change and impact needed to 
  reshape the focus, the actions and decisions in black communities nationally. Building 
  centralized black political power is uprooting business as usual and an atmosphere of complacency 
  in a white supremacist power structure that doesn’t humanize the facts and struggles we are 
  faced with daily. Being in this space, I hope to engage with folks who are passionately 
  searching for new methods whether technological or conventional to move black communities 
  into sustained political action for generations to come. I don’t want to lose anymore 
  cultural wealth in spaces where I used to feel safe that are no longer spaces for my young 
  nieces and cousins. I want to be able to strategize with community members nationally about what 
  we will do moving forward. Moving forward centralized black political power is showing up at 
  uninvited tables, taking a seat and seasoning the food with the salty looks you get from 
  displaying your truths.
